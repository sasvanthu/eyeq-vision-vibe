# EyeQ Club - Computer Vision Community at SIMATS

Welcome to the EyeQ Club website, a student-run Computer Vision club at Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMATS).

## About EyeQ

EyeQ is a vibrant community where students come together to learn, create, and innovate in the field of Computer Vision. Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world tech skills through collaborative projects and hands-on coding sessions.

### Our Motto
**See. Code. Create.**

## What Makes EyeQ Different?

- **Anyone Can Teach One**: Every member is both a learner and a mentor
- **No Skills Required**: Start your journey from zero with our supportive community
- **Curiosity Over Competition**: We focus on exploration and innovation
- **24/7 Energy Loop**: A community that's always active and always learning

## Tech Stack

This project is built with modern web technologies:

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **Shadcn UI** - Component library
- **React Scroll** - Smooth scrolling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or pnpm or bun

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd eyeq-vision-vibe
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default) or the port shown in the terminal.

Note about authentication (development):

- The app normally requires Firebase authentication for member/admin areas. For faster local development you can skip auth — both the Member and Admin dashboards will load without signing in. Use the following paths:

	- Member Dashboard: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
	- Admin Dashboard: `http://localhost:5173/eyeqcontrol2k25`

These endpoints will fetch public data where available and allow submitting test projects/contributions. When you're ready to re-enable auth, revert the temporary bypasses in `src/pages/member/Dashboard.tsx` and `src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
